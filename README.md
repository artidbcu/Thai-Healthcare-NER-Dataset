## üß† Overview

This repository contains the datasets, annotation scripts, and documentation.

The dataset provides the **first comprehensive Thai healthcare corpus** annotated with **SNOMED CT** concept types.  
It was developed using a **rule-based word reconstruction algorithm** combined with **Typhoon 2.0**, a state-of-the-art Thai large language model (LLM), to enhance segmentation and ontology alignment in Thai medical text.

## üß© Dataset Description

The dataset contains:
- **166,849 Thai tokens**
- **9,022 annotated entity spans**
- **18 SNOMED CT top-level categories**

Each token is tagged using the standard **BIO (Begin‚ÄìInside‚ÄìOutside)** scheme and aligned with **SNOMED CT** ontology types such as:

- *Body structure*
- *Clinical finding*
- *Environments and geographical locations*
- *Event*
- *Observable entity*
- *Organism*
- *Pharmaceutical/biologic product*
- *Physical force*
- *Physical object*
- *Procedure*
- *Qualifier value*
- *Record artifact*
- *Situation with explicit context*
- *Social context*
- *Special concept*
- *Specimen*
- *Staging and scales*
- *Substance*

All annotations were partially validated by **healthcare specialists** to ensure **semantic accuracy** and **clinical relevance**.

## üß™ Methodology Summary

1. **Data Collection:**  
   500 Thai healthcare articles were retrieved from [Thai Journals Online (ThaiJO)](https://www.tci-thaijo.org/) between 2021‚Äì2024 (Tier 1 journals under TCI).

2. **Rule-Based Word Reconstruction:**  
   POS-tag sequences were analysed to reconstruct compound nouns (e.g., `NCMN + NPRP + VACT`).  
   Algorithm achieved **F1 = 0.61** at threshold 0.4.

3. **Annotation with SNOMED CT:**  
   The **Typhoon 2.0** model was prompted with structured JSON templates to map terms to SNOMED CT categories.

4. **BIO and Instruction Dataset Creation:**  
   Annotations were converted to BIO format for token-level NER and instruction‚Äìresponse format for LLM fine-tuning.

5. **Manual Validation:**  
   Review by three medical domain experts achieved **accuracy = 68.81%**, confirming semantic correctness and practical reliability.

## üìä Technical Validation

| Metric | Score |
|---------|-------|
| Precision | 0.89 |
| Recall | 0.69 |
| F1 Score | 0.75 |
| Manual validation accuracy | 68.81% |
| Compound noun reconstruction F1 | 0.61 |

Validation confirms the dataset‚Äôs quality and suitability for both **sequence labelling** and **instruction-tuned learning** tasks in Thai healthcare NLP.

## üí° Use Cases

- Thai medical **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**  
- **Ontology-aware** NLP systems aligned with SNOMED CT  
- **Fine-tuning** of Thai instruction-following LLMs (e.g., Typhoon 2.0, Mistral-7B-Instruct)  
- **Knowledge Graph** construction and clinical term normalization  
- **Cross-lingual** research for low-resource healthcare NLP
